# Godot-4-Networking-Demonstration-NetworkSynchronizerSpawner
Basically a fork of the [outdated repo](https://github.com/TheGodojo/Godot-4-Networking-Demonstration-Complete) from [TheGodojo](https://github.com/TheGodojo), streamlining it with [MultiplayerSpawner](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_multiplayerspawner.html) logic and [MultiplayerSynchronizer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html)

[Full tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8QpnamQq1A), because in the current absence of netcoding documentation for 4.0 (demos full of errors, misleading docs), it is the best resource out there. NetworkSpawner is much needed imo, makes it a lot cleaner, and easier to understand too!
